# WordsGame

The words are stored and connected in a graph data structure that was built using maps and the concept of wildcards.

The rules are simple. Given two words, the goal is to transform the first word into the second word by changing a single letter repeatedly.

Automatic Mode: The user selects the root word and the target word. Then, the program will find the shortest path between the two words.

Playing Mode: The user selects the length of the words and the program randomly selects two words. Afterwards, the user will try to get to the second word by changing letters. The user can also use hints which will be automatically used and displayed.

Analytics Module: The user inputs a name and the program loads all the unique words the user has used playing the game. All the data is stored in a .csv file.
